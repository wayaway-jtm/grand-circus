  Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an)
  <mad-lib-form placeholder="(adjective)"></mad-lib-form> amusement park. It was a
  fun park with lots of cool <mad-lib-form placeholder="(plural noun)"></mad-lib-form>
  and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my
  kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the
  <mad-lib-form placeholder="(noun)"></mad-lib-form>." We all pushed out in a terrible
  hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and
  we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out
  what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller
  coaster I really liked so, I <mad-lib-form placeholder="(adverb)"></mad-lib-form> ran
  over to get in the long line that had about
  <mad-lib-form placeholder="(number)"></mad-lib-form> people in it. When I finally
  got on the roller coaster I was <mad-lib-form placeholder="(past tense verb)"></mad-lib-form>. In fact I was so
  nervous
  my
  two knees
  were knocking together. This was the <mad-lib-form placeholder="(-est adjective)"></mad-lib-form> ride I had ever been
  on!
  In about two
  minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears.
  Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom,
  I was a little <mad-lib-form placeholder="(past tense verb)"></mad-lib-form> but I
  was proud of myself. The rest of the day went
  <mad-lib-form placeholder="(adverb)"></mad-lib-form>. It was a(n) <mad-lib-form placeholder="(adjective)">
  </mad-lib-form>
  day at the fun park.
